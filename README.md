# React Dictionary

**React Dictionary** is a Front End Development project that explores the use of REST Api's in a dictionary app in which the user looks up a word and the app returns valuable information, such as:

- part of speech
- word definition
- examples
- synonyms
- word-related images

This project was created during the [SheCodes React Workshop](https://www.shecodes.io/).
